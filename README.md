# 4 Light Distance Shadows
Using multiple directional lights to acheive shadows at varying distances and sizes.

A way to have shadows of tiny objects up close, and far large distance objects as well. In Godot 4.1.3 there is a limit of 4 directional lights before it starts flickering badly. However in the upcoming 4.2 that seems to be fixed and you can have more than 4. Keep in mind though that if you have too many, it will wash out the shadow intensity.
